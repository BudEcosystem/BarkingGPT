# BarkingGPT (Audio2Audio)
[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

BarkingGPT is our experiment with Whisper, LLMs & Bark to give LLMs the ability to be able to speak, sing & express emotions just the way a human would do. The technology still have a long way to go to be able to make this experience reliable & consistent. 

Currently barkingGPT supports all the emotions bark supports, we use single shot Instruction prompting to create a BarkAgent with ChatGPT that can laugh, sigh, sing, gasp, show hesitation, clears thought & create a little bit of music (We are working on integrating other expert models to provide better music experience with BarkingGPT).

**You can find a few of our results below:**

- [ ] TODO

Currently the model takes around 2.30 mins on a 4 x A100, to be able to generate 1.15 secs clip on a single thread. We are trying to optimise it to make it suitable for Agent like scenarios with almost real-time Q&A. 

## Tech RoadMap 

1. UI Improvements
2. Support for other LLMs (Vicuna & Alpaca)
3. Code refactoring
4. Documentation 
5. JAX whisper
6. Speaking & Barking Agents (Integration with AutoGPT)
7. Consistent music generation with Diffusion
8. Prompt collection


## General observations:
1. Bark, the text-to-speech API, has a limit of 32 tokens per request. Therefore, we had to split long paragraphs into sentences with a maximum of 32 tokens, generate audio for each sentence, and then merge the audio together to create the final audio output.
2. Non-speech sounds such as [laugh] do not work at the beginning of a sentence.
